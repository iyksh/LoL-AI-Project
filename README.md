# LoL-Autocicker
### I'll be introducing you to the script that I developed using Python libraries. 

## Requirements
Python 3.10+

OpenCV-Python
PyautoGUI
Pynput
Pillow
Tk
Subprocess.run
Tesseract

## Usage

To get started with the autoclicker, simply run the "install.py" script. This will launch an application that will automatically install all of the necessary requirements for you. 
Once that's done, you can run the "startup.py" script and the autoclicker will be up and running, ready for use.

## Libraries descriptions:

> - OpenCV-Python is a library that provides computer vision and machine learning algorithms in Python. It's primarily used for image and video processing, object detection, face recognition, and tracking.
> - PyAutoGUI is a library that enables Python to simulate mouse movements, keyboard presses, and other GUI events. It can be used to automate GUI testing, perform repetitive tasks, and create macros. 
> - Pynput is a library that allows Python to control and monitor input devices, such as keyboards and mice
> - Pillow is a Python Imaging Library that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
> - Tk is a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that provides a set of widgets, such as buttons, menus, and text boxes, for creating desktop applications
> - Subprocess.run is a function that allows a Python program to execute external commands, such as shell scripts or system commands, from within a Python program
> - Tesseract is an open-source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine that can recognize text from images
